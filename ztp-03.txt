Detailed Synthesis & Critique
Synthesis of Current Ideas:

Your organization has successfully implemented Zero Touch Production (ZTP) through the Carrier system, leveraging Kubernetes, ArgoCD, GitLab, AWS services like EKS, and other technologies. This system automates permission management, ensuring that all production changes are either automated, prevalidated, or require audited approvals. This foundational work has minimized human error, enforced least privilege access, and enhanced auditability and security.
Critique of Current Implementation:

While the Carrier system effectively enforces security and automates permissions, several challenges remain:

    Latency: The dependency on GitLab pull requests (PRs) and CI processes introduces delays in permission changes.
    Human Oversight: Engineers manually revoking permissions can lead to oversights and potential security risks.
    System Dependencies: Reliance on GitLab and CI uptime creates single points of failure.
    Operational Overhead: Managing multiple interconnected systems increases complexity and operational burden.
    Metrics Tracking: Current metrics may not fully capture the system's effectiveness or identify all areas for improvement.
