Certainly! If you're hosting your website on a public server instance (e.g., a Linode VPS) with a static IP address instead of using AWS CloudFront, the DNS configuration and SSL certificate setup will differ slightly. Below, I'll provide step-by-step instructions for registering a domain and configuring DNS using both AWS Route 53 and GoDaddy, tailored for pointing to a public server IP. Additionally, I'll guide you through obtaining and configuring SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt, which is a widely-used free SSL certificate provider suitable for non-AWS environments.
Overview

    Register a Domain:
        Using AWS Route 53 or GoDaddy.
    Configure DNS Records:
        Point your domain to your server's IP address using A Records.
    Obtain and Configure SSL Certificate:
        Use Let's Encrypt with tools like Certbot to secure your website.
    Verify Your Setup:
        Ensure your website is accessible via HTTPS and properly secured.

Option 1: Registering and Configuring Your Domain with AWS Route 53
Prerequisites:

    An active AWS account.
    A public server instance (e.g., Linode) with a static IP address.
    Access to your server via SSH to install SSL certificates.

Step 1: Register a Domain in Route 53

    Sign in to the AWS Management Console:
        Navigate to AWS Management Console.

    Access Route 53:
        From the AWS Services menu, select Route 53 under the Networking & Content Delivery section.

    Register a New Domain:
        In the Route 53 dashboard, click on "Registered domains" in the left sidebar.
        Click the "Register Domain" button.

    Search for Your Desired Domain:
        Enter your preferred domain name (e.g., bestcandidatecv.com) in the search box.
        Click "Check" to see if the domain is available.

    Select and Register the Domain:
        If available, select the domain and proceed.
        Provide the required contact information (registrant, administrative, and technical contacts).
        Choose the registration period (typically 1 year, with options to extend).
        Review and confirm the details, then complete the purchase.

    Verify Domain Registration:
        AWS may send a verification email to the contact email provided. Follow the instructions in the email to verify your domain.

Step 2: Configure DNS Records in Route 53

    Create a Hosted Zone:
        After registration, Route 53 will automatically create a Hosted Zone for your domain.
        Navigate to "Hosted zones" in Route 53 to view it.

    Add an A Record Pointing to Your Server's IP:
        In your hosted zone, click "Create record".
        Choose "Simple routing" and click "Next".

    Define the Record Details:
        Record name: Leave blank for the root domain (bestcandidatecv.com) or enter www if you want www.bestcandidatecv.com.
        Record type: Select A – IPv4 address.
        Value: Enter your server's static IP address (e.g., 123.45.67.89).
        TTL (Time to Live): You can leave it at the default value (e.g., 300 seconds).

    Save the Record:
        Click "Create records" to save.

    (Optional) Redirect www to Root Domain or Vice Versa:
        If you set up an A record for bestcandidatecv.com, you might want to redirect www.bestcandidatecv.com to the root domain or vice versa.
        This can be done by adding additional A records or using Route 53's Alias features.

Step 3: Obtain and Configure SSL Certificate Using Let's Encrypt

Since you're hosting on a non-AWS server, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is not applicable. Instead, we'll use Let's Encrypt with Certbot to obtain and install SSL certificates.
a. Install Certbot on Your Server

    Access Your Server via SSH:

    bash

ssh your_username@123.45.67.89

Update Your Package List:

bash

sudo apt update

Install Certbot:

    For Nginx:

    bash

sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

For Apache:

bash

    sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache

Verify Installation:

bash

    certbot --version

b. Obtain and Install the SSL Certificate

    For Nginx Users:

    bash

sudo certbot --nginx -d bestcandidatecv.com -d www.bestcandidatecv.com

For Apache Users:

bash

sudo certbot --apache -d bestcandidatecv.com -d www.bestcandidatecv.com

Follow the Prompts:

    Enter your email address.
    Agree to the terms of service.
    Choose whether to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS (recommended).

Automatic Renewal:

    Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Certbot sets up automatic renewal. To test the renewal process:

    bash

        sudo certbot renew --dry-run

c. Verify SSL Installation

    Access Your Website:
        Open a web browser and navigate to https://bestcandidatecv.com and https://www.bestcandidatecv.com.

    Check SSL Certificate:
        Ensure the connection is secure (look for the padlock icon).
        Click the padlock to view certificate details, confirming it’s issued for your custom domain.

Step 4: Verify Your Setup

    DNS Propagation:
        DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally, though they often update much sooner.

    Use Terminal Commands to Verify DNS Records:
        Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
        Run the following command to check DNS resolution:

        bash

        nslookup bestcandidatecv.com

        Ensure it resolves to your server's IP address (123.45.67.89).

    Check SSL Certificate:
        Visit your website using https:// and verify that the SSL certificate is valid and matches your custom domain.

Option 2: Registering and Configuring Your Domain with GoDaddy
Prerequisites:

    An active GoDaddy account.
    A public server instance (e.g., Linode) with a static IP address.
    Access to your server via SSH to install SSL certificates.

Step 1: Register a Domain on GoDaddy

    Visit GoDaddy:
        Go to GoDaddy's website.

    Search for Your Desired Domain:
        Use the search bar to enter your preferred domain name (e.g., bestcandidatecv.com).
        Click "Search Domain".

    Select and Purchase the Domain:
        If available, add the domain to your cart.
        Proceed to checkout, providing necessary contact and payment information.
        Complete the purchase.

    Verify Domain Registration:
        GoDaddy may send a verification email. Follow the instructions to verify your new domain.

Step 2: Configure DNS Records in GoDaddy

    Access Domain Management:
        Log in to your GoDaddy account.
        Click on "My Products".
        Find your domain under "Domains" and click "DNS" or "Manage DNS".

    Add an A Record Pointing to Your Server's IP:
        In the "Records" section, click "Add".
        Type: Select A.
        Name: Enter @ to represent the root domain (bestcandidatecv.com) or www for www.bestcandidatecv.com.
        Value: Enter your server's static IP address (e.g., 123.45.67.89).
        TTL: Leave at default or set as desired (e.g., 1 hour).
        Click "Save".

    (Optional) Redirect www to Root Domain or Vice Versa:
        If you set up an A record for bestcandidatecv.com, you might want to redirect www.bestcandidatecv.com to the root domain or vice versa.
        Set Up Forwarding:
            Scroll down to the "Forwarding" section.
            Click "Add" under "Domain".
            Forward to: Enter https://bestcandidatecv.com or https://www.bestcandidatecv.com as desired.
            Redirect type: Choose 301 (Permanent).
            Settings: Select "Forward only" or "Forward with masking" as preferred.
            Click "Save".

    Note: Unlike Route 53, GoDaddy doesn't support ALIAS or ANAME records, so forwarding is a common workaround.

Key Points to Remember

    DNS Records:
        A Record: Points your domain (e.g., bestcandidatecv.com) to your server's IPv4 address.
        CNAME Record: Not typically needed when pointing directly to an IP. Use CNAMEs for subdomains pointing to other domains or services.
        TTL (Time to Live): Determines how long DNS resolvers cache the information. Lower values mean quicker propagation but more DNS queries.

    SSL Certificates:
        Let's Encrypt: A free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA) that provides SSL certificates.
        Certbot: A tool to automate the process of obtaining and renewing Let's Encrypt certificates.
        Automatic Renewal: Ensure Certbot's renewal process is set up to avoid certificate expiration.

    Server Configuration:
        Web Server Software: Ensure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) is properly configured to use the obtained SSL certificates.
        Firewall Settings: Make sure ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are open on your server to allow web traffic.

    DNS Propagation:
        Changes to DNS records can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally, though they often update much sooner.

    Security Best Practices:
        Redirect HTTP to HTTPS: Ensure all traffic is encrypted by redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS.
        Regular Updates: Keep your server and software up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.
        Firewall Configuration: Restrict unnecessary ports and services to enhance server security.

Final Verification and Troubleshooting

Regardless of whether you choose AWS Route 53 or GoDaddy, after completing the above steps, it's essential to verify that your domain correctly points to your server and that the SSL certificate is properly configured.
1. DNS Propagation

    Check DNS Status:
        Use online tools like WhatsMyDNS to check DNS record propagation globally.
    Terminal Commands:

    bash

nslookup bestcandidatecv.com

or

bash

    dig bestcandidatecv.com

2. Verify SSL Certificate

    Browser Check:
        Open a web browser and navigate to https://bestcandidatecv.com.
        Ensure the connection is secure (look for the padlock icon).
        Click the padlock to view certificate details, confirming it’s issued for your custom domain.

    SSL Testing Tools:
        Use tools like SSL Labs' SSL Test to perform a comprehensive analysis of your SSL configuration.

3. Confirm Server Configuration

    Web Server Status:

        Ensure your web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) is running without errors.

        For Nginx:

        bash

sudo systemctl status nginx

For Apache:

bash

    sudo systemctl status apache2

Check SSL Configuration:

    Verify that your web server is correctly referencing the SSL certificate and key files.

    For Nginx (Example):

    nginx

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name bestcandidatecv.com www.bestcandidatecv.com;
            return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }

        server {
            listen 443 ssl;
            server_name bestcandidatecv.com www.bestcandidatecv.com;

            ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/bestcandidatecv.com/fullchain.pem;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/bestcandidatecv.com/privkey.pem;

            # ... other configurations ...
        }

4. Common Issues and Solutions

    Issue: Website Not Accessible via HTTPS
        Solution:
            Ensure that the SSL certificate is correctly installed.
            Verify that your web server is configured to listen on port 443.
            Check firewall settings to allow HTTPS traffic.

    Issue: DNS Records Not Propagating
        Solution:
            Double-check DNS record entries for typos or incorrect values.
            Verify that nameservers are correctly set (especially important if managing DNS outside of the registrar).
            Wait for DNS changes to propagate.

    Issue: SSL Certificate Not Renewing Automatically
        Solution:
            Ensure Certbot's renewal cron job or systemd timer is active.
            Test renewal manually:

            bash

            sudo certbot renew --dry-run

    Issue: Mixed Content Warnings
        Solution:
            Ensure all resources (images, scripts, stylesheets) are loaded over HTTPS.
            Update website code to use HTTPS URLs or relative paths.

Additional Tips

    Use HTTPS Everywhere:
        Ensure all website traffic uses HTTPS by configuring your web server to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.

    Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):

        Instruct browsers to only use HTTPS when communicating with your website, enhancing security.

        For Nginx:

        nginx

add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

For Apache:

apache

        Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"

    Optimize SSL Configuration:

        Use strong ciphers and disable outdated protocols to enhance security.

        Refer to Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator for best practices.

    Monitor Server Performance and Security:
        Implement monitoring tools to keep track of server uptime and performance.
        Use security tools like fail2ban to protect against brute-force attacks.

    Backup Configurations and Data:
        Regularly back up your server configurations and website data to prevent data loss.

    Leverage Documentation and Support:
        Refer to AWS Route 53 Documentation and GoDaddy DNS Documentation for detailed guidance.
        Utilize Let's Encrypt's Certbot Documentation for SSL setup assistance.

Final Clarification

    A Records vs. CNAME Records:
        A Record: Directly maps a domain to an IPv4 address. Use this when pointing to a server with a static IP.
        CNAME Record: Maps a domain to another domain name. Use this for subdomains pointing to services like AWS CloudFront or other platforms.

    SSL Certificate Management:
        Let's Encrypt is ideal for external servers as it provides free SSL certificates and automates the issuance and renewal process.
        AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is best suited for AWS-managed services like CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, etc., and isn't directly applicable to external servers.

    Security Considerations:
        Always ensure your server is updated and secured against vulnerabilities.
        Regularly monitor SSL certificate statuses and renewals to maintain secure connections.

By following these steps tailored for pointing your domain to a public server IP, you can successfully register, configure, and secure your website using either AWS Route 53 or GoDaddy along with Let's Encrypt for SSL certification.
