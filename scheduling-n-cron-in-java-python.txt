Scheduled Web Apps in Java and Python



R
Create two full runnable web apps one in java and springboot using @scheduled for a cron job in a service and another in Pydantic flask api using schedule add job


I'd be happy to create two runnable web apps for you - one using Java and Spring Boot with a scheduled cron job, and another using Python with Flask and Pydantic. I'll provide the code for each app separately. Let's start with the Java/Spring Boot app:

Java Spring Boot App with @Scheduled Cron Job
First, ensure you have Java and Maven installed. Then create a new Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies. Here's the main application class:

java

Copy
package com.example.cronapp;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableScheduling
public class CronAppApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CronAppApplication.class, args);
    }
}
Now, let's create a service class with a scheduled job:

java

Copy
package com.example.cronapp.service;

import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Service
public class ScheduledTaskService {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 * * * * ?") // Runs every minute
    public void scheduledTask() {
        System.out.println("Scheduled task running at: " + LocalDateTime.now());
    }
}
This app will run a scheduled task every minute, printing the current time.

To run this app, use the command: mvn spring-boot:run

Now, let's create the Python Flask app with Pydantic and scheduled job:

Python Flask App with Pydantic and Scheduled Job
First, install the necessary packages:


Copy
pip install flask pydantic schedule
Here's the full app:

python

Copy
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from pydantic import BaseModel
import schedule
import time
from threading import Thread
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float

items = []

def scheduled_task():
    print(f"Scheduled task running at: {datetime.now()}")

def run_schedule():
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

@app.route('/items', methods=['GET'])
def get_items():
    return jsonify([item.dict() for item in items])

@app.route('/items', methods=['POST'])
def add_item():
    new_item = Item(name="New Item", price=9.99)
    items.append(new_item)
    return jsonify(new_item.dict()), 201

if __name__ == '__main__':
    schedule.every(1).minutes.do(scheduled_task)
    
    # Run the scheduler in a separate thread
    scheduler_thread = Thread(target=run_schedule)
    scheduler_thread.start()
    
    app.run(debug=True)
This Flask app does the following:

Defines a Pydantic model for items
Provides GET and POST endpoints for items
Runs a scheduled task every minute using the schedule library
Runs the scheduler in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main Flask app
To run this app, save it as app.py and use the command: python app.py

Both apps are now ready to run. The Java app uses Spring Boot's built-in scheduling capabilities, while the Python app uses the schedule library to achieve similar functionality.

Would you like me to explain or break down any part of these code samples?

R
They should both add more than one service to cron. The python should use the schedule library and fast api


I apologize for the misunderstanding. I'll revise both applications to include multiple scheduled services and use FastAPI instead of Flask for the Python app. Here are the updated versions:

Java Spring Boot App with multiple @Scheduled Cron Jobs
java

Copy
package com.example.cronapp;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableScheduling
public class CronAppApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CronAppApplication.class, args);
    }
}
Now, let's create a service class with multiple scheduled jobs:

java

Copy
package com.example.cronapp.service;

import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Service
public class ScheduledTaskService {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 * * * * ?") // Runs every minute
    public void minutelyTask() {
        System.out.println("Minutely task running at: " + LocalDateTime.now());
    }

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 */5 * * * ?") // Runs every 5 minutes
    public void fiveMinuteTask() {
        System.out.println("Five-minute task running at: " + LocalDateTime.now());
    }

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?") // Runs every hour
    public void hourlyTask() {
        System.out.println("Hourly task running at: " + LocalDateTime.now());
    }
}
Python FastAPI App with Pydantic and Scheduled Jobs
Here's the revised Python app using FastAPI, Pydantic, and the schedule library:

python

Copy
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import schedule
import time
from threading import Thread
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float

items = []

def minutely_task():
    print(f"Minutely task running at: {datetime.now()}")

def five_minute_task():
    print(f"Five-minute task running at: {datetime.now()}")

def hourly_task():
    print(f"Hourly task running at: {datetime.now()}")

def run_schedule():
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

@app.on_event("startup")
def start_scheduler():
    schedule.every(1).minutes.do(minutely_task)
    schedule.every(5).minutes.do(five_minute_task)
    schedule.every(1).hours.do(hourly_task)
    
    # Run the scheduler in a separate thread
    scheduler_thread = Thread(target=run_schedule)
    scheduler_thread.start()

@app.get("/items")
def get_items():
    return items

@app.post("/items")
def add_item(item: Item):
    items.append(item)
    return item

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
To run this FastAPI app, you'll need to install the required packages:


Copy
pip install fastapi uvicorn schedule
Then run the app with:


Copy
python app.py
This revised version includes the following changes:

For the Java Spring Boot app:
Added three scheduled tasks: minutely, every 5 minutes, and hourly.
For the Python app:
Switched from Flask to FastAPI.
Used Pydantic for data validation.
Implemented three scheduled tasks using the schedule library: minutely, every 5 minutes, and hourly.
Used FastAPI's startup event to initialize the scheduler.
Kept the scheduler running in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main application.
Both applications now have multiple scheduled services running at different intervals. The Java app uses Spring's built-in scheduling, while the Python app uses the schedule library as requested.

Would you like me to explain or break down any part of these updated code samples?

R
The jobs for python should be added in the main


I apologize for the oversight. You're right, we should add the jobs in the main part of the Python script. Here's the revised Python FastAPI app with the scheduled jobs added in the main section:

python

Copy
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import schedule
import time
from threading import Thread
from datetime import datetime
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float

items = []

def minutely_task():
    print(f"Minutely task running at: {datetime.now()}")

def five_minute_task():
    print(f"Five-minute task running at: {datetime.now()}")

def hourly_task():
    print(f"Hourly task running at: {datetime.now()}")

def run_schedule():
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

@app.get("/items")
def get_items():
    return items

@app.post("/items")
def add_item(item: Item):
    items.append(item)
    return item

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Add scheduled jobs
    schedule.every(1).minutes.do(minutely_task)
    schedule.every(5).minutes.do(five_minute_task)
    schedule.every(1).hours.do(hourly_task)
    
    # Run the scheduler in a separate thread
    scheduler_thread = Thread(target=run_schedule)
    scheduler_thread.start()

    # Run the FastAPI app
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
In this updated version:

We've moved the job scheduling to the if __name__ == "__main__": block.
The scheduled jobs are now added just before starting the FastAPI server.
We've removed the @app.on_event("startup") decorator and the start_scheduler() function, as they're no longer needed.
The scheduler thread is started in the main block, ensuring it runs alongside the FastAPI server.
This approach ensures that the scheduled jobs are added and the scheduler is started when the script is run directly, but not when the module is imported.

To run this FastAPI app, you'll still need to install the required packages:


Copy
pip install fastapi uvicorn schedule
Then run the app with:


Copy
python app.py
This setup will start both the FastAPI server and the scheduled jobs when you run the script. The jobs will run at their specified intervals (every minute, every 5 minutes, and every hour) while the API is available to handle requests.

R
Now lets make this scheguling Kubernetes natice to use cron jobs assuming the apps are running in Kubernetes


Certainly! I'll provide you with Kubernetes configurations for both the Java Spring Boot and Python FastAPI applications, using Kubernetes CronJobs for scheduling instead of in-application scheduling. This approach is more Kubernetes-native and allows for better resource management and scaling.

Let's start with the modifications to both applications and then provide the Kubernetes configurations.

Java Spring Boot App
For the Java app, we'll remove the @Scheduled annotations and create separate classes for each job. Here's an example for one job:

java

Copy
package com.example.cronapp.jobs;

public class MinutelyJob {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Minutely job running at: " + java.time.LocalDateTime.now());
    }
}
Create similar classes for FiveMinuteJob and HourlyJob.

Python FastAPI App
For the Python app, we'll remove the scheduling logic and create separate scripts for each job:

minutely_job.py:

python

Copy
from datetime import datetime

print(f"Minutely job running at: {datetime.now()}")
Create similar scripts for five_minute_job.py and hourly_job.py.

Now, let's create the Kubernetes configurations for both applications:

Kubernetes Configurations
First, we'll create Deployments for both apps, and then we'll create CronJobs for the scheduled tasks.

Java Spring Boot App Deployment (java-deployment.yaml):

yaml

Copy

        ports:

Now, let's create the CronJobs for both applications:

To apply these configurations to your Kubernetes cluster:

Update the image names in the YAML files to match your actual Docker image names and tags.
Apply the configurations:

Copy
kubectl apply -f java-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f python-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f java-cronjobs.yaml
kubectl apply -f python-cronjobs.yaml
This setup runs your main applications as Deployments and schedules the jobs using Kubernetes CronJobs, which is more native to Kubernetes and allows for better resource management and scaling.

this is how the actual code looks like: @Component
public class EncryptionMigrationTask {

    private final EncryptionMigrationService migrationService;

    public EncryptionMigrationTask(EncryptionMigrationService migrationService) {
        this.migrationService = migrationService;
    }

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * *?") // Run at 2 AM every day
    public void runMigration() {
        migrationService.migrateEncryptedData();
    }
}


I see. Thank you for providing the actual code. Let's adapt this to a Kubernetes-native approach using CronJobs. We'll need to make a few changes to the application and create a Kubernetes CronJob configuration.

Modify the Java application:
Instead of using the @Scheduled annotation, we'll create a main method that runs the migration task directly. Here's how you can modify your class:

java

Copy
@Component
public class EncryptionMigrationTask {

    private final EncryptionMigrationService migrationService;

    public EncryptionMigrationTask(EncryptionMigrationService migrationService) {
        this.migrationService = migrationService;
    }

    public void runMigration() {
        migrationService.migrateEncryptedData();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(YourApplicationConfig.class);
        EncryptionMigrationTask migrationTask = context.getBean(EncryptionMigrationTask.class);
        migrationTask.runMigration();
    }
}
Make sure to replace YourApplicationConfig.class with the actual configuration class for your Spring application.

Create a Kubernetes CronJob configuration:
Now, let's create a Kubernetes CronJob that will run this task daily at 2 AM. Create a file named encryption-migration-cronjob.yaml with the following content:

yaml

Copy
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: encryption-migration-job
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: encryption-migration
            image: your-java-app-image:tag
            command: ["java", "-cp", "/app/classes:/app/libs/*", "com.yourpackage.EncryptionMigrationTask"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
Make sure to replace the following:

your-java-app-image:tag with the actual image name and tag of your Java application.
/app/classes:/app/libs/* with the actual classpath in your Docker image.
com.yourpackage.EncryptionMigrationTask with the fully qualified name of your EncryptionMigrationTask class.
Apply the CronJob to your Kubernetes cluster:
bash

Copy
kubectl apply -f encryption-migration-cronjob.yaml
This setup will run your encryption migration task every day at 2 AM, which matches the schedule you had in your @Scheduled annotation.

A few things to note:

Ensure that your Docker image contains all necessary dependencies and configuration files.
The CronJob will create a new Pod for each execution, so make sure your application can handle multiple concurrent runs if necessary.
You may need to set up appropriate RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) if your migration task requires special permissions within the cluster.
Consider adding resource limits and requests to the container specification in the CronJob to ensure it has the necessary resources to run.

its within a larger application and i have many of such with crons at different times: @Scheduled(cron = "${codeQuality.cron.storeMetrics}")  // This cron expression means "Run once a day at midnight"
@Override
public void fetchAndStoreMetrics() {
    sonarApplicationRepository.findAll().forEach(sonarApplicationEntity -> {
        try {
            ApplicationScoreDto metrics = codeQualityService.getMetrics(sonarApplicationEntity.getApplicationId());
            log.info("Metrics fetched for application ID: {}", sonarApplicationEntity.getApplicationId());
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            log.error("Failed to fetch metrics for application ID: {}: {}", sonarApplicationEntity.getApplicationId(), ex.getMessage());
        }
    });
}

@Scheduled(cron = "${codeQuality.cron.expression}")
public void calculateAndUpdateRanking() {
    LocalDate yesterday = LocalDate.now().minusDays(1);
    boolean success = codeQualityRankingService.createOrUpdateRanking(yesterday);
    if (success) {
        log.info("Successfully updated ranking for {}", yesterday);
    } else {
        log.error("Failed to update ranking for {}", yesterday);
    }

}


I understand. You have multiple scheduled tasks within a larger application, each with different cron schedules. In this case, we'll need to take a different approach to make this Kubernetes-native while preserving the functionality of your application. Here's how we can adapt this:

Keep the existing @Scheduled annotations in your application. This allows the application to function normally when not running in Kubernetes.
Create a Kubernetes Deployment for your main application.
Use Kubernetes CronJobs to trigger these specific tasks by making HTTP requests to your application.
Here's how to implement this:

Modify your application to expose endpoints for these tasks:
java

Copy
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/tasks")
public class ScheduledTasksController {

    private final CodeQualityService codeQualityService;
    private final CodeQualityRankingService codeQualityRankingService;
    private final SonarApplicationRepository sonarApplicationRepository;

    // Constructor injection

    @PostMapping("/fetch-and-store-metrics")
    public ResponseEntity<String> fetchAndStoreMetrics() {
        sonarApplicationRepository.findAll().forEach(sonarApplicationEntity -> {
            try {
                ApplicationScoreDto metrics = codeQualityService.getMetrics(sonarApplicationEntity.getApplicationId());
                log.info("Metrics fetched for application ID: {}", sonarApplicationEntity.getApplicationId());
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                log.error("Failed to fetch metrics for application ID: {}: {}", sonarApplicationEntity.getApplicationId(), ex.getMessage());
            }
        });
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Metrics fetched and stored");
    }

    @PostMapping("/calculate-and-update-ranking")
    public ResponseEntity<String> calculateAndUpdateRanking() {
        LocalDate yesterday = LocalDate.now().minusDays(1);
        boolean success = codeQualityRankingService.createOrUpdateRanking(yesterday);
        if (success) {
            log.info("Successfully updated ranking for {}", yesterday);
            return ResponseEntity.ok("Ranking updated successfully");
        } else {
            log.error("Failed to update ranking for {}", yesterday);
            return ResponseEntity.internalServerError().body("Failed to update ranking");
        }
    }
}
Create a Kubernetes Deployment for your main application (if not already existing):
yaml

Copy
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app
        image: your-app-image:tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
Create Kubernetes CronJobs to trigger these tasks:
yaml

Copy
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: fetch-and-store-metrics
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"  # Run once a day at midnight
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: curl
            image: curlimages/curl
            command: ["curl", "-X", "POST", "http://your-app-service:8080/tasks/fetch-and-store-metrics"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: calculate-and-update-ranking
spec:
  schedule: "0 1 * * *"  # Run once a day at 1 AM
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: curl
            image: curlimages/curl
            command: ["curl", "-X", "POST", "http://your-app-service:8080/tasks/calculate-and-update-ranking"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
Make sure to replace your-app-service with the actual name of your Kubernetes service.

Apply these configurations:
bash

Copy
kubectl apply -f your-app-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f scheduled-tasks-cronjobs.yaml
This approach offers several benefits:

Your application remains functional whether it's running in Kubernetes or not.
You can easily adjust the schedule of these tasks by modifying the CronJob configurations without changing your application code.
The tasks are executed within the context of your running application, ensuring access to all necessary services and data.
You can monitor and manage these tasks using Kubernetes tools.
Remember to secure these endpoints appropriately, perhaps by using Kubernetes network policies or implementing authentication in your application.

cool so in this way we can remove the @scheduled annotations


Absolutely, you're correct. In this Kubernetes-native approach, we can indeed remove the @Scheduled annotations from the application code. This separation of concerns allows for more flexibility in scheduling and better aligns with Kubernetes practices. Let's revise the approach to reflect this change:

Modify your application code:
Remove the @Scheduled annotations and convert the scheduled methods into regular methods that can be called via HTTP endpoints. Here's how your code might look after these changes:

java

Copy
@Service
public class CodeQualityService {

    private final SonarApplicationRepository sonarApplicationRepository;
    private final CodeQualityRankingService codeQualityRankingService;

    // Constructor injection

    public void fetchAndStoreMetrics() {
        sonarApplicationRepository.findAll().forEach(sonarApplicationEntity -> {
            try {
                ApplicationScoreDto metrics = getMetrics(sonarApplicationEntity.getApplicationId());
                log.info("Metrics fetched for application ID: {}", sonarApplicationEntity.getApplicationId());

Keep your Kubernetes Deployment for the main application:
yaml

Copy
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app
        image: your-app-image:tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
Create Kubernetes CronJobs to trigger these tasks:
yaml

Copy
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: fetch-and-store-metrics
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"  # Run once a day at midnight
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: curl
            image: curlimages/curl
            command: ["curl", "-X", "POST", "http://your-app-service:8080/tasks/fetch-and-store-metrics"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: calculate-and-update-ranking
spec:
  schedule: "0 1 * * *"  # Run once a day at 1 AM
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: curl
            image: curlimages/curl
            command: ["curl", "-X", "POST", "http://your-app-service:8080/tasks/calculate-and-update-ranking"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
This approach offers several advantages:

Scheduling is now entirely managed by Kubernetes, making it easier to adjust schedules without changing application code.
The application is more focused on its core functionality, with scheduling concerns handled externally.
You can easily test these tasks by calling the endpoints directly, without waiting for a scheduled time.
It's easier to manage and monitor these tasks using Kubernetes tools.
Remember to secure these endpoints appropriately, perhaps by using Kubernetes network policies or implementing authentication in your application.

This setup gives you the flexibility to run your application both in and out of Kubernetes environments. If you need to run it outside of Kubernetes, you could implement a simple scheduler in your application that calls these methods directly, or use a tool like cron to make HTTP requests to these endpoints at the desired intervals.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this setup?

R
is there a different way?


Certainly! There are indeed alternative approaches we can consider. Let's explore a different way to handle scheduled tasks in a Kubernetes environment:

Kubernetes Jobs with InitContainers
Instead of using CronJobs, we can use regular Kubernetes Jobs with InitContainers. This approach allows us to run pre-job checks or setup tasks before executing the main job.

Here's how it might look:

yaml

Copy
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: code-quality-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: wait-for-app
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nc -z your-app-service 8080; do echo waiting for app; sleep 2; done;']
      containers:
      - name: code-quality-task
        image: your-app-image:tag
        command: ["java", "-cp", "/app/classes:/app/libs/*", "com.yourpackage.CodeQualityTaskRunner"]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
In this setup, you'd create a new class CodeQualityTaskRunner in your application that runs your tasks:

java

Copy
public class CodeQualityTaskRunner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(YourAppConfig.class);
        CodeQualityService service = context.getBean(CodeQualityService.class);
        
        service.fetchAndStoreMetrics();
        service.calculateAndUpdateRanking();
    }
}
Separate Microservice for Scheduled Tasks
Another approach is to create a separate microservice dedicated to running these scheduled tasks. This service could be much simpler, focused solely on executing these tasks at specified intervals.

java

Copy
@SpringBootApplication
public class SchedulerService {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SchedulerService.class, args);
    }
}

@Component
public class ScheduledTasks {
    private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public ScheduledTasks(RestTemplate restTemplate) {
        this.restTemplate = restTemplate;
    }

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?")
    public void runCodeQualityTasks() {
        restTemplate.postForEntity("http://your-app-service:8080/tasks/fetch-and-store-metrics", null, String.class);
        restTemplate.postForEntity("http://your-app-service:8080/tasks/calculate-and-update-ranking", null, String.class);
    }
}
You'd deploy this as a separate service in your Kubernetes cluster:

yaml

Copy
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: scheduler-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: scheduler-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: scheduler-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: scheduler-service
        image: your-scheduler-service-image:tag
Kubernetes Custom Controller
For a more advanced solution, you could create a custom Kubernetes controller that manages your scheduled tasks. This would involve developing a controller that watches for custom resources defining your tasks and schedules.

Here's a simplified example of what a custom resource might look like:

yaml

Copy
apiVersion: yourcompany.com/v1
kind: ScheduledTask
metadata:
  name: code-quality-task
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  endpoint: "http://your-app-service:8080/tasks/fetch-and-store-metrics"
Your custom controller would watch for these resources and create Jobs or Pods to execute the tasks based on the specified schedule.

Each of these approaches has its own benefits and trade-offs:

The Job with InitContainer approach keeps everything within Kubernetes but requires creating a new Job for each execution.
The separate microservice approach allows you to keep using @Scheduled annotations but introduces another service to maintain.
The custom controller approach provides the most flexibility and Kubernetes-native feel but requires significant development effort.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches?

R
the python version we have to convert looks like from apscheduler.schedulers.blocking import BlockingScheduler

from service.incident_scheduler_service import incident_details_scheduler
from service.scheduler_service import maturity_calculation_scheduler

if name == "main":
    scheduler = BlockingScheduler()

    scheduler_timings = os.getenv('SCHEDULER_TIMINGS')
    timing_values = [timing.strip() for timing in scheduler_timings.split(',')]
    for timing_str in timing_values:
        scheduler.add_job(maturity_calculation_scheduler, 'cron', hour=int(timing_str.split(':')[0]),
                          minute=int(timing_str.split(':')[1]))

    incident_scheduler_timings = os.getenv('INCIDENT_SCHEDULER_TIMINGS')
    second_timing_values = [timing.strip() for timing in incident_scheduler_timings.split(',')]
    print(second_timing_values)
    for timing_str in second_timing_values:
        scheduler.add_job(incident_details_scheduler, 'cron', hour=int(timing_str.split(':')[0]),
                          minute=int(timing_str.split(':')[1]))

    # Start the scheduler
    try:
        scheduler.start()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Scheduler stopped.")


I see. You're using APScheduler in a Python application to schedule multiple jobs at different times. To make this Kubernetes-native, we'll need to modify this approach. Here's how we can adapt this to work well with Kubernetes:

Create separate scripts for each job:
maturity_calculation_job.py:

python

Copy
from service.scheduler_service import maturity_calculation_scheduler

if __name__ == "__main__":
    maturity_calculation_scheduler()
incident_details_job.py:

python

Copy
from service.incident_scheduler_service import incident_details_scheduler

if __name__ == "__main__":
    incident_details_scheduler()
Create a Kubernetes Deployment for your main application (if it doesn't already exist):
yaml

Copy
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-python-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-python-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-python-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-python-app
        image: your-python-app-image:tag
        env:
        - name: SCHEDULER_TIMINGS
          value: "2:00,14:00"
        - name: INCIDENT_SCHEDULER_TIMINGS
          value: "3:00,15:00"
Create Kubernetes CronJobs for each scheduled task:
yaml

Copy
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: maturity-calculation-job-1
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"

This approach offers several advantages:

It removes the need for APScheduler in your main application, simplifying your code.
Each job runs in its own container, providing isolation and making it easier to manage resources.
You can easily modify the schedule or add new jobs by updating the Kubernetes CronJob configurations.
It's more scalable and easier to monitor using Kubernetes native tools.

Modify your Dockerfile to include the new job scripts (maturity_calculation_job.py and incident_details_job.py).
Build and push your updated Docker image.
Apply the Kubernetes configurations (Deployment and CronJobs) to your cluster.
Remember to adjust the schedules in the CronJob configurations to match your SCHEDULER_TIMINGS and INCIDENT_SCHEDULER_TIMINGS environment variables.

This setup allows you to manage your scheduled tasks using Kubernetes native features while keeping your application code focused on its core functionality. The main application can still access the environment variables if needed, but the scheduling is handled entirely by Kubernetes.

R
can we use this same idea for the springboot?


Absolutely! We can apply the same principle to the Spring Boot application. This approach will make the scheduling Kubernetes-native for both your Python and Java applications. Let's adapt the Spring Boot application using this idea:

Create separate classes for each job:
MaturityCalculationJob.java:

java

Copy
package com.yourcompany.jobs;

import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MaturityCalculationJob {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MaturityCalculationJob.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner run(YourService yourService) {
        return args -> {
            yourService.calculateAndUpdateRanking();
            System.exit(0);
        };
    }
}
CodeQualityMetricsJob.java:

java

Copy
package com.yourcompany.jobs;

import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class CodeQualityMetricsJob {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CodeQualityMetricsJob.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner run(YourService yourService) {
        return args -> {
            yourService.fetchAndStoreMetrics();
            System.exit(0);
        };
    }
}
Remove @Scheduled annotations from your main application.
Create Kubernetes CronJobs for each scheduled task:
yaml

Copy
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: maturity-calculation-job
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Run at 2 AM daily
  jobTemplate:

            command: ["java", "-cp", "/app/classes:/app/libs/*", "com.yourcompany.jobs.CodeQualityMetricsJob"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
Keep your main Spring Boot application Deployment:
yaml

Copy
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-springboot-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-springboot-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-springboot-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-springboot-app
        image: your-springboot-app-image:tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080

R
can we put all the jobs in one file?


Certainly! We can consolidate all the jobs into a single file for both the Spring Boot and Python applications. This approach can simplify management and reduce the number of files you need to maintain. Let's look at how we can do this for both:

For Spring Boot:

Create a single Java file for all jobs:
java

Copy
package com.yourcompany.jobs;

import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ScheduledJobs {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length < 1) {
            System.out.println("Please specify the job to run: maturityCalculation or codeQualityMetrics");
            System.exit(1);
        }
        SpringApplication.run(ScheduledJobs.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner run(YourService yourService) {
        return args -> {
            switch (args[0]) {
                case "maturityCalculation":
                    yourService.calculateAndUpdateRanking();
                    break;
                case "codeQualityMetrics":
                    yourService.fetchAndStoreMetrics();
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.println("Unknown job: " + args[0]);
            }
            System.exit(0);
        };
    }
}
Update the Kubernetes CronJob configurations:
yaml

Copy
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: maturity-calculation-job
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Run at 2 AM daily
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: maturity-calculation
            image: your-springboot-app-image:tag
            command: ["java", "-cp", "/app/classes:/app/libs/*", "com.yourcompany.jobs.ScheduledJobs", "maturityCalculation"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: code-quality-metrics-job
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"  # Run at midnight daily
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: code-quality-metrics

            command: ["java", "-cp", "/app/classes:/app/libs/*", "com.yourcompany.jobs.ScheduledJobs", "codeQualityMetrics"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
For Python:

Create a single Python file for all jobs:
python

Copy
import sys
from service.scheduler_service import maturity_calculation_scheduler
from service.incident_scheduler_service import incident_details_scheduler

def run_job(job_name):
    if job_name == "maturity_calculation":
        maturity_calculation_scheduler()
    elif job_name == "incident_details":
        incident_details_scheduler()
    else:
        print(f"Unknown job: {job_name}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Please specify the job to run: maturity_calculation or incident_details")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    run_job(sys.argv[1])
Update the Kubernetes CronJob configurations:
yaml

Copy
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: maturity-calculation-job-1
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: maturity-calculation
            image: your-python-app-image:tag
            command: ["python", "scheduled_jobs.py", "maturity_calculation"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure

            image: your-python-app-image:tag
            command: ["python", "scheduled_jobs.py", "maturity_calculation"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure

            command: ["python", "scheduled_jobs.py", "incident_details"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
This approach has several benefits:

All jobs are managed in a single file, making it easier to maintain and update.
You can easily add new jobs by adding new cases to the switch statement (Java) or if-else block (Python).
The Kubernetes configurations remain largely the same, just with updated command arguments.
To implement this:

Create the new consolidated job file in your project.
Update your Dockerfile to ensure this new file is included in the built image.
Build and push your updated Docker image.
Apply the updated Kubernetes CronJob configurations to your cluster.
This setup maintains the benefits of Kubernetes-native scheduling while simplifying your codebase. Each job still runs in its own container, providing isolation and resource management, but the logic for all jobs is centralized in a single file.
