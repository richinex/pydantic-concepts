Option 1: Registering and Configuring Your Domain with AWS Route 53
Prerequisites:

    An active AWS account.
    Your CloudFront distribution DNS name (e.g., d1hjtv5xjv873g.cloudfront.net).

Step 1: Register a Domain in Route 53

    Sign in to the AWS Management Console:
        Navigate to AWS Management Console.

    Access Route 53:
        From the AWS Services menu, select Route 53 under the Networking & Content Delivery section.

    Register a New Domain:
        In the Route 53 dashboard, click on "Registered domains" in the left sidebar.
        Click the "Register Domain" button.

    Search for Your Desired Domain:
        Enter your preferred domain name (e.g., bestcandidatecv.com) in the search box.
        Click "Check" to see if the domain is available.

    Select and Register the Domain:
        If available, select the domain and proceed.
        Provide the required contact information (registrant, administrative, and technical contacts).
        Choose the registration period (typically 1 year, with options to extend).
        Review and confirm the details, then complete the purchase.

    Verify Domain Registration:
        AWS may send a verification email to the contact email provided. Follow the instructions in the email to verify your domain.

        Click "Create records".

Step 3: Obtain and Configure SSL Certificate

    Access AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):
        From the AWS Services menu, select Certificate Manager under Security, Identity, & Compliance.

    Request a Public Certificate:
        Click "Request a certificate".
        Select "Request a public certificate" and click "Request a certificate".

    Enter Domain Names:
        Add your domain (e.g., bestcandidatecv.com) and any subdomains (e.g., www.bestcandidatecv.com).
        Click "Next".

    Choose Validation Method:
        DNS Validation is recommended for ease with Route 53.
        Select DNS validation and click "Next".

    Review and Request:
        Review your settings and click "Confirm and request".

    Add DNS Validation Records:
        ACM will provide CNAME records for validation.
        Navigate back to your Route 53 Hosted Zone.
        Click "Create record" and add the provided CNAME records.
        Wait for validation to complete (usually a few minutes to an hour).

    Associate SSL Certificate with CloudFront:
        Navigate to CloudFront in the AWS Management Console.
        Select your distribution and click "Edit".
        Under "Settings", find "SSL Certificate".
        Choose "Custom SSL Certificate" and select the certificate you just validated.
        Save changes and allow CloudFront to deploy the update (this may take some time).

Step 4: Verify Your Setup

    Access Your Domain:
        Open a web browser and navigate to https://bestcandidatecv.com and https://www.bestcandidatecv.com.
    Check SSL Certificate:
        Ensure the connection is secure (look for the padlock icon).
        Click the padlock to view certificate details, confirming it’s issued for your custom domain.

Option 2: Registering and Configuring Your Domain with GoDaddy
Prerequisites:

    An active GoDaddy account.
    Your CloudFront distribution DNS name (e.g., d1hjtv5xjv873g.cloudfront.net).
    Access to AWS Certificate Manager for SSL (you'll need to manage SSL through AWS).

Step 1: Register a Domain on GoDaddy

    Visit GoDaddy:
        Go to GoDaddy's website.

    Search for Your Desired Domain:
        Use the search bar to enter your preferred domain name (e.g., bestcandidatecv.com).
        Click "Search Domain".

    Select and Purchase the Domain:
        If available, add the domain to your cart.
        Proceed to checkout, providing necessary contact and payment information.
        Complete the purchase.

    Verify Domain Registration:
        GoDaddy may send a verification email. Follow the instructions to verify your new domain.

Step 2: Configure DNS Records in GoDaddy

    Access Domain Management:
        Log in to your GoDaddy account.
        Click on "My Products".
        Find your domain under "Domains" and click "DNS" or "Manage DNS".

    Add a CNAME Record Pointing to CloudFront:
        In the "Records" section, click "Add".
        Type: Select CNAME.
        Name: Enter www (for www.bestcandidatecv.com).
        Value: Enter your CloudFront distribution's DNS name (e.g., d1hjtv5xjv873g.cloudfront.net).
        TTL: Leave at default or set as desired (e.g., 1 hour).
        Click "Save".

    Add an A Record for Apex Domain Using GoDaddy’s Forwarding (Optional):

        GoDaddy does not support ALIAS or ANAME records, so to point the root domain (bestcandidatecv.com) to CloudFront, you can use domain forwarding.

        Set Up Forwarding:
            In the "Forwarding" section, click "Add" under "Domain".
            Forward to: Enter https://www.bestcandidatecv.com.
            Redirect type: Choose 301 (Permanent).
            Settings: Select "Forward only" or "Forward with masking" as preferred.
            Click "Save".

    Note: Alternatively, use a service like Cloudflare for more advanced DNS features if needed.

Step 3: Obtain and Configure SSL Certificate in AWS

    Access AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):
        From the AWS Management Console, navigate to Certificate Manager under Security, Identity, & Compliance.

    Request a Public Certificate:
        Click "Request a certificate".
        Select "Request a public certificate" and click "Request a certificate".

    Enter Domain Names:
        Add your domain (e.g., bestcandidatecv.com) and any subdomains (e.g., www.bestcandidatecv.com).
        Click "Next".

    Choose Validation Method:
        DNS Validation is recommended. Select it and click "Next".

    Review and Request:
        Review your settings and click "Confirm and request".

    Add DNS Validation Records in GoDaddy:
        ACM will provide CNAME records for validation.
        In your GoDaddy DNS Management page, click "Add" under "Records".
        Type: Select CNAME.
        Name: Enter the name provided by ACM.
        Value: Enter the value provided by ACM.
        TTL: Leave at default or set as desired.
        Click "Save".
        Repeat for any additional CNAME records provided by ACM.
        Wait for ACM to validate the domain (this may take a few minutes to an hour).

    Associate SSL Certificate with CloudFront:
        Navigate to CloudFront in the AWS Management Console.
        Select your distribution and click "Edit".
        Under "Settings", find "SSL Certificate".
        Choose "Custom SSL Certificate" and select the certificate you just validated.
        Save changes and allow CloudFront to deploy the update (this may take some time).

Step 4: Verify Your Setup

    Access Your Domain:
        Open a web browser and navigate to https://bestcandidatecv.com and https://www.bestcandidatecv.com.

    Check SSL Certificate:
        Ensure the connection is secure (look for the padlock icon).
        Click the padlock to view certificate details, confirming it’s issued for your custom domain.

Final Verification and Troubleshooting

Regardless of the registrar you choose (Route 53 or GoDaddy), after completing the above steps, it's essential to verify that your domain correctly points to your AWS-hosted static website and that the SSL certificate is properly configured.

    DNS Propagation:
        DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally, though they often update much sooner.

    Use Terminal Commands to Verify DNS Records:
        Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
        Run the following command to check DNS resolution:

        bash

        nslookup bestcandidatecv.com

        Ensure it resolves to your CloudFront distribution's DNS name.

    Check SSL Certificate:
        Visit your website using https:// and verify that the SSL certificate is valid and matches your custom domain.

    Common Issues:
        DNS Misconfiguration: Double-check DNS records for typos or incorrect entries.
        SSL Certificate Not Issued: Ensure that DNS validation records are correctly added and propagated.
        CloudFront Distribution Settings: Verify that CloudFront is configured to use the correct SSL certificate and that your origin is correctly set.

Additional Tips

    Use HTTPS Everywhere: Ensure all your website traffic uses HTTPS by configuring CloudFront to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.

    Enable Caching: Optimize your CloudFront settings to cache your static website content efficiently, reducing load times.

    Monitor Costs: Both AWS Route 53 and GoDaddy have associated costs for domain registration and DNS management. Monitor your AWS billing dashboard and GoDaddy account to stay informed.

    Automate Renewals: Enable auto-renewal for your domain registration and SSL certificates to prevent accidental expirations.

By following these steps, you'll have a memorable, secure, and professionally branded domain pointing to your AWS-hosted static website, enhancing both accessibility and credibility.
