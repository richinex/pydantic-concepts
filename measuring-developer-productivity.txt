How can we measure some of the ideas here given some tools used by developers like gitlab and jira etc make the paper more practical for me

To make the ideas from this paper more practical using tools like GitLab and Jira, we can adapt some of the measurement approaches described. Here are some suggestions:

    Define developer goals: Translate the high-level developer goals outlined in the paper to your specific context. For example, "Write high quality code" or "Ensure code contributed by others is high quality" could be relevant goals to measure.
    Use GitLab metrics:
        Code review time: Measure the average time it takes for merge requests to be reviewed and approved.
        Merge request frequency: Track how often developers are submitting code for review.
        Pipeline success rate: Monitor the success rate of CI/CD pipelines as an indicator of code quality.
    Utilize Jira data:
        Issue resolution time: Measure how long it takes to resolve different types of issues.
        Sprint completion rate: Track how well teams are meeting their sprint goals.
        Bugs created vs resolved: Monitor the ratio of new bugs to resolved bugs over time.
    Combine behavioral and sentiment data:
        Use GitLab and Jira data for behavioral metrics.
        Implement periodic developer surveys (similar to Google's EngSat) to gather sentiment data about how well supported developers feel in achieving their goals.
    Map tool-specific metrics to higher-level goals: Create a mapping between the metrics available in GitLab and Jira to the higher-level developer goals you've defined. This allows you to see how well your tools are supporting developers in achieving their goals.
    Implement log-based measurements: While you may not have access to the same level of logging as Google, you can use GitLab and Jira APIs to create custom logs of developer actions. This can help you track specific journeys developers take to accomplish their goals.
    Analyze patterns: Look for correlations between sentiment data from surveys and behavioral data from GitLab and Jira. For example, do developers who report feeling well-supported in code review also have faster review times or higher quality contributions?
    Focus on durability: When defining goals and metrics, ensure they are technology-agnostic and will remain relevant even as tools and practices evolve.
    Regular review and iteration: Periodically review your goals and metrics to ensure they remain relevant and valuable. Be prepared to adjust your measurement approach as your development practices change.

By adapting these ideas to commonly used tools like GitLab and Jira, you can create a more practical framework for measuring developer productivity and experience in your specific context. This approach allows you to focus on developer goals while using the data available from your existing toolset.


More concrete ideas
=================================

Certainly. Here are more concrete implementations of these ideas using GitLab and Jira:

    Define specific developer goals:
        "Complete code reviews within 24 hours"
        "Maintain a test coverage of at least 80%"
        "Resolve critical bugs within 48 hours"
    GitLab metrics:
        Code review time: Set up a GitLab CI/CD metric to track the average time between when a merge request is opened and when it's merged.
        Code quality: Use GitLab's built-in code quality reports to track the number of code smells, vulnerabilities, and bugs over time.
        Pipeline success rate: Create a dashboard in GitLab that shows the percentage of successful pipelines per day or week.
    Jira data:
        Issue resolution time: Create a Jira dashboard that shows average resolution time for different issue types (bugs, features, tasks).
        Sprint completion rate: Use Jira's built-in reports to track the percentage of story points completed in each sprint.
        Bug tracking: Set up a custom Jira report that shows the ratio of new bugs created to bugs resolved on a weekly basis.
    Combine behavioral and sentiment data:
        Behavioral: Export data from GitLab and Jira into a data visualization tool like Tableau or Power BI.
        Sentiment: Use a tool like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms to run quarterly developer surveys. Ask questions like "On a scale of 1-5, how well supported do you feel in achieving [specific goal]?"
    Concrete goal-metric mapping example: Goal: "Complete code reviews within 24 hours" Metrics:
        GitLab: Average time to merge
        Jira: Time spent in "In Review" status
        Survey: Developer satisfaction with code review process
    Log-based measurements: Use GitLab webhooks to log events like:
        When a merge request is opened
        When comments are added to a merge request
        When a merge request is approved or merged Store these logs in a database for analysis.
    Pattern analysis: Create a script that correlates GitLab merge request data with Jira issue data. For example, analyze if merge requests linked to high-priority Jira issues are reviewed and merged faster.
    Durable metrics example: Instead of measuring "Number of Git commits per day" (which could change with different version control systems), measure "Number of discrete code contributions per day" which could apply regardless of the specific tool used.
    Regular review process: Schedule a quarterly meeting with team leads to review the current goals and metrics. Use this time to:
        Assess if the metrics are driving desired behaviors
        Identify any new goals that have emerged
        Retire any metrics that are no longer relevant

By implementing these concrete steps, you'll be able to create a practical, data-driven approach to measuring and improving developer productivity using GitLab and Jira. This system will provide you with actionable insights while remaining flexible enough to adapt to changes in your development practices.


How does this correlate with the Dora metrics be detailed
===================================================================

The ideas presented in the paper and the suggested implementations can be closely correlated with the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics. DORA metrics are a set of key performance indicators used to measure software delivery performance. Let's examine how these correlate in detail:

    Deployment Frequency

DORA Definition: How often an organization successfully releases to production.

Correlation:

    This aligns with the paper's "Experiment, Release and Rollout" phase.
    Can be measured using GitLab's deployment data.
    Relates to the goal "Safely Roll Out Changes to Production".

Implementation:

    Use GitLab's CI/CD metrics to track the number of successful deployments to production per day or week.
    Create a custom dashboard in GitLab to visualize deployment frequency over time.

    Lead Time for Changes

DORA Definition: The time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production.

Correlation:

    This spans multiple phases in the paper, including "Develop, Test and Commit Code" and "Experiment, Release and Rollout".
    Aligns with goals like "Write High Quality Code" and "Integrate New Tools/Technology into Existing Services and Systems".

Implementation:

    Use GitLab's cycle analytics feature to measure the time from first commit to production deployment.
    Combine with Jira data to track the full lifecycle from issue creation to deployment.
    Create a custom metric that measures the time from when a Jira issue moves to "In Progress" to when the associated GitLab merge request is deployed to production.

    Time to Restore Service

DORA Definition: How long it takes to restore service when a failure occurs in production.

Correlation:

    This aligns with the paper's "Monitoring, Reliability, and Configuring Infrastructure" phase.
    Relates to goals like "Investigate Issues in Production" and "Improve Reliability and Avoid Production Problems".

Implementation:

    Use Jira to track incidents and their resolution times.
    Create a custom field in Jira for "Time to Restore Service" and generate reports based on this field.
    Integrate with your incident management tool (e.g., PagerDuty) to automatically log incident start and end times in Jira.

    Change Failure Rate

DORA Definition: The percentage of changes that result in degraded service or require remediation.

Correlation:

    This relates to the "Experiment, Release and Rollout" phase and the "Monitoring, Reliability, and Configuring Infrastructure" phase.
    Aligns with goals like "Ensure My Product Stays Within SLO Commitments" and "Improve System Performance".

Implementation:

    Use GitLab's deployment metrics to track failed deployments.
    Create a custom field in Jira to flag issues that were caused by recent deployments.
    Calculate the ratio of failed deployments or post-deployment issues to total deployments.

Additional Correlations:

    Code Review Process

While not a direct DORA metric, this is crucial for code quality which impacts all DORA metrics.

Correlation:

    Aligns with the goal "Ensure the Code Contributed by Others is High Quality".

Implementation:

    Use GitLab's code review metrics to track review times, number of comments, and approval rates.
    Correlate this with the change failure rate to see if thorough code reviews lead to fewer production issues.

    Test Coverage and Quality

Again, not a direct DORA metric but impacts all four metrics.

Correlation:

    Relates to the goal "Create or Maintain Holistic Test Coverage".

Implementation:

    Use GitLab's built-in test coverage reports.
    Track the number of tests added with each merge request.
    Correlate test coverage with change failure rate and time to restore service.

    Developer Satisfaction

While not a DORA metric, it's crucial for overall productivity and can impact all DORA metrics.

Correlation:

    This is directly related to the paper's approach of measuring developer sentiment alongside behavioral data.

Implementation:

    Conduct regular developer surveys as suggested in the paper.
    Correlate survey results with DORA metrics to see how developer satisfaction impacts performance.

By implementing these correlations, you can create a comprehensive measurement system that not only tracks the DORA metrics but also provides deeper insights into the developer experience and how it impacts these key performance indicators. This approach allows you to identify specific areas for improvement in your development process that will directly impact your DORA metrics and overall software delivery performance.
